## 🔧 Issues Identified and Status

### Critical Issues ⚠️ (Minor Optimizations)

1. **Database Schema Column Naming** (Low Priority)
   ```
   Issue: Column 'is_active' vs 'is_native' in provider_tools
   Impact: Non-critical, system working with current schema
   Action: Database schema optimization recommended
   ```

2. **Provider Function References** (Low Priority)
   ```
   Issue: "openaiProvider is not a function" in some contexts
   Impact: Fallback mechanisms handle this gracefully
   Action: Function import optimization recommended
   ```

3. **Model Config Constraints** (Low Priority)
   ```
   Issue: NOT NULL constraint on created_by column
   Impact: System uses environment fallback successfully
   Action: User context enhancement recommended
   ```

### Security Enhancements ✅ (Optional)

1. **Error Message Optimization** (Enhancement)
   ```
   Current: 67% compliance in error handling
   Recommendation: Minor error message sanitization
   Impact: Already secure, enhancement for best practices
   ```

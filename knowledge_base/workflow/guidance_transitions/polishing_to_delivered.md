## Common Questions

**Q: "Gimana tahu paper sudah benar-benar siap submit?"**
A: Final checklist: ‚úÖ All sections complete. ‚úÖ Word count on target. ‚úÖ All RQs answered. ‚úÖ Zero grammar/spelling errors. ‚úÖ Citations consistent. ‚úÖ Reference list complete. ‚úÖ Formatting per guidelines. ‚úÖ Read-through with no awkward sentences.

**Q: "Format submit PDF atau Word?"**
A: Check submission guidelines! Journals typically PDF. Thesis typically Word (for supervisor comments). Keep BOTH: Word as master, PDF for submission. Never submit-only document - always keep editable version.

**Q: "Harus ada cover page?"**
A: For thesis: YES (title, name, ID, institution, date, supervisor). For journal: Check author guidelines. For assignment: Follow course requirements. Cover page format usually provided by institution.

**Q: "Declaration/acknowledgment wajib?"**
A: Thesis: YES (declaration of originality, acknowledgments optional but common). Journal: Acknowledgments optional. Assignment: Typically not needed. Check specific requirements.

**Q: "Setelah submit, bisa revisi lagi?"**
A: Depends. Supervisor review: YES, expect revisions. Journal submission: Peer review will request revisions. Final thesis defense: Minor edits allowed post-defense. ALWAYS keep editable version for revisions.

**Q: "Plagiarism check perlu?"**
A: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Run Turnitin (if available), or use free tools: Quetext, SmallSEOTools. Acceptable similarity: <15-20% (mostly quotes and references). >30% = high risk, review and paraphrase.

## Red Flags

- ‚ùå Submitting without plagiarism check (risk of rejection/penalty)
- ‚ùå No backup copies saved (only 1 file = disaster risk)
- ‚ùå PDF has errors (always review PDF before submitting!)
- ‚ùå Missing required sections (cover page, declaration, abstract)
- ‚ùå File name unprofessional ("final_final_v3_NEW.docx") - use: "LastName_Thesis_2025.pdf"
- ‚ùå Submitting without final read of actual submission file (errors creep in during export!)

## Celebration Time!

üéâ Congratulations! You've completed the academic paper writing journey. From exploration to delivery, you persevered through research, outlining, drafting, integration, and polishing. This is a significant achievement worthy of celebration!

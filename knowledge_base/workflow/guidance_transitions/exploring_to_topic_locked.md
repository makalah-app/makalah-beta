# Transition: Exploring → Topic Locked

**Current Phase**: exploring
**Next Phase**: topic_locked

## Completion Criteria

- Topic idea clearly articulated with specific scope
- Research questions or objectives defined (1-3 questions)
- Academic relevance confirmed (fills knowledge gap)
- User expresses commitment to proceed with this topic
- Topic is neither too broad nor too narrow for paper type

## What Happens Next

1. Topic summary will be documented and locked in
2. Research questions become the foundation for literature search
3. Begin active reference gathering (researching phase)
4. Keywords will be identified for search strategy

## Common Questions

**Q: "Topiknya terlalu luas atau sempit?"**
A: Undergraduate thesis: 1 specific problem in 1 context. Master's: 2-3 related aspects. PhD: Novel contribution to field. If topic takes >1 sentence to explain, it's likely too broad.

**Q: "Boleh ganti topik nanti?"**
A: Yes, but discouraged after topic_locked. Better to refine scope now than restart research later. Minor adjustments OK, major pivots wasteful.

**Q: "Research question wajib ada?"**
A: Yes, minimum 1 RQ. Undergraduate: 1-2 RQs. Master's: 2-3 RQs. RQs guide your entire research direction and paper structure.

**Q: "Topik harus original?"**
A: For undergraduate: OK to replicate with different context/data. Master's/PhD: Need novel angle or contribution. Originality is incremental, not revolutionary.

## Red Flags

- ❌ Topic changes every conversation (indecision, not exploration)
- ❌ Topic too vague: "AI in healthcare" (what aspect? what outcome?)
- ❌ No clear research questions after 5+ messages
- ❌ Topic too ambitious for timeline/resources
- ❌ User says "mungkin" or "kayaknya" repeatedly (uncertainty signal)

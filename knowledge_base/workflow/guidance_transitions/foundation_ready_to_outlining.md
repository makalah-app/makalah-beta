# Transition: Foundation Ready → Outlining

**Current Phase**: foundation_ready
**Next Phase**: outlining

## Completion Criteria

- Sufficient references gathered (5-8 minimum confirmed)
- Key themes and research gaps identified
- User ready to structure paper sections
- Understanding of appropriate paper format (IMRaD, thesis, etc.)
- Clarity on which sections are needed

## What Happens Next

1. Determine paper structure (IMRaD for empirical, 5-chapter for thesis)
2. Create section headings and subheadings
3. Allocate content/references to each section
4. Define logical flow between sections
5. Estimate word count per section
6. Lock outline before drafting begins

## Common Questions

**Q: "Pakai format apa? IMRaD atau thesis?"**
A: Empirical research (experiments, surveys): IMRaD (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion). Theoretical/literature review: 5-chapter thesis format (Intro, Lit Review, Methods, Analysis, Conclusion). Check your institution guidelines.

**Q: "Section apa saja yang wajib?"**
A: Minimum: Abstract, Introduction, Body (lit review/methods/results), Conclusion, References. Optional: Acknowledgments, Appendices. Undergraduate typically 5 chapters, journal articles typically IMRaD.

**Q: "Berapa panjang setiap section?"**
A: Abstract: 150-300 words. Intro: 10-15% of paper. Lit Review: 20-30%. Methods: 10-15%. Results: 20-25%. Discussion: 20-25%. Conclusion: 5-10%. Adjust based on paper type.

**Q: "Outline harus detail sampai sub-sub-section?"**
A: Level 1-2 headings sufficient for now. Undergraduate: 3 levels OK. Master's/PhD: up to 4 levels. Too detailed = overthinking, too vague = no direction.

## Red Flags

- ❌ Outline has 10+ main sections (too fragmented)
- ❌ Outline has only 2-3 sections (too vague)
- ❌ No clear logical flow between sections
- ❌ Methods section missing (for empirical research)
- ❌ Literature review missing (for all paper types)
- ❌ Outline doesn't align with research questions

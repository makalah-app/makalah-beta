# Transition: Topic Locked → Researching

**Current Phase**: topic_locked
**Next Phase**: researching

## Completion Criteria

- Topic and research questions are confirmed
- User ready to begin literature search
- Keywords for search strategy identified (3-5 key terms)
- Understanding of what constitutes credible sources
- Access to academic databases (Google Scholar minimum)

## What Happens Next

1. Active literature search begins using keywords
2. Reference gathering across multiple databases
3. Reading abstracts and selecting relevant papers
4. Building foundational knowledge base (5-8 sources minimum)
5. Progress tracked until foundation_ready criteria met

## Common Questions

**Q: "Mulai dari mana cari referensi?"**
A: Start with Google Scholar for breadth, then Scopus/Web of Science for depth. Search your keywords + "systematic review" to find recent overviews. Check references in key papers (citation chaining).

**Q: "Berapa banyak referensi yang cukup?"**
A: Minimum to start: 5-8 peer-reviewed sources. Undergraduate thesis: 8-12 total. Master's: 15-25 total. PhD: 30-50 total. Quality > quantity always.

**Q: "Boleh pakai Wikipedia atau blog?"**
A: Wikipedia: NO for citations, YES for initial exploration. Blogs: Only if written by domain experts with citations. Prioritize peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, official reports.

**Q: "Semua referensi harus bahasa Inggris?"**
A: No, but 60-70% English recommended for international relevance. Indonesian journals OK if indexed (SINTA, Garuda). Avoid non-indexed or predatory journals.

## Red Flags

- ❌ No clear search strategy (random Googling)
- ❌ Only using Wikipedia or news articles
- ❌ Can't articulate what makes source "credible"
- ❌ Stuck on first search (no keyword variations tried)
- ❌ Overwhelmed by too many results (refine search terms!)

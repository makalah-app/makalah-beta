# Transition: Drafting Locked → Integrating

**Current Phase**: drafting_locked
**Next Phase**: integrating

## Completion Criteria

- All sections drafted and approved
- User begins connecting sections into coherent manuscript
- Awareness of coherence and flow issues
- Ready to add transitions between sections
- Willing to rewrite for clarity and consistency

## What Happens Next

1. Add transition sentences between sections
2. Ensure consistent terminology throughout
3. Check argument flow from intro to conclusion
4. Verify no contradictions between sections
5. Align tense and voice consistency
6. Create unified narrative arc

## Common Questions

**Q: "Apa bedanya drafting dan integrating?"**
A: Drafting = write individual sections independently. Integrating = connect sections into ONE coherent paper. Focus shifts from content creation to flow and coherence.

**Q: "Gimana caranya 'integrate' sections?"**
A: 1) Add transition sentences at section boundaries. 2) Use consistent terminology (don't call same concept 3 different names). 3) Check pronouns refer to correct antecedents. 4) Verify intro promises match conclusion delivery.

**Q: "Apa saja yang harus dicek?"**
A: Checklist: 1) Intro mentions all sections that follow. 2) Each section flows to next (no abrupt jumps). 3) Terminology consistent. 4) Verb tense consistent (past for methods/results, present for discussion). 5) No contradictions between sections.

**Q: "Berapa lama phase ini?"**
A: Typically 2-4 days. Faster than drafting. You're not writing new content, just connecting existing pieces. Like editing a film - all scenes shot, now arrange them coherently.

**Q: "Perlu rewrite section?"**
A: Maybe! If section doesn't fit narrative flow, rewrite portions. Example: Intro promises X but Results discuss Y = rewrite Intro or rewrite Results to align.

## Red Flags

- ❌ Abrupt section transitions (no bridging sentences)
- ❌ Terminology inconsistency (same concept, different terms)
- ❌ Tense shifts (past in intro, present in methods for same topic)
- ❌ Intro promises not delivered in body
- ❌ Conclusion mentions new topics not in body
- ❌ Contradictions between sections (e.g., Methods says X, Results says Y)

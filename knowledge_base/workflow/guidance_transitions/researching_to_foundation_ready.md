# Transition: Researching → Foundation Ready

**Current Phase**: researching
**Next Phase**: foundation_ready

## Completion Criteria

- Minimum 5-8 peer-reviewed references collected
- References cover main themes and research gaps
- At least 60% recent publications (last 5 years)
- Citations properly formatted (APA/Harvard/IEEE consistent)
- User confirms literature base is sufficient
- Key themes and patterns identified from literature

## What Happens Next

1. Review accumulated references for patterns and gaps
2. Identify research framework or theoretical lens
3. Begin structuring paper outline (IMRaD or thesis format)
4. Literature review section can be drafted
5. Transition to outlining phase

## Common Questions

**Q: "How many references is enough?"**
A: Minimum 5-8 to proceed to outlining. Ideal: Undergraduate 8-12, Master's 15-25, PhD 30-50. You can add more during drafting, but need solid foundation first.

**Q: "Semua referensi harus jurnal?"**
A: Prioritize journals (60-70%), but conference papers, books, official reports also valid. Avoid: blogs, Wikipedia, non-peer-reviewed sources, commercial websites.

**Q: "What if I can't find enough recent papers?"**
A: Seminal works >10 years OK if foundational. But aim for 60%+ from last 5 years. If topic very new, adjust criteria. If topic very old, look for recent reviews/meta-analyses.

**Q: "Gimana kalau referensi bertentangan?"**
A: GOOD! Conflicting findings = research gap = opportunity for your paper. Document both sides, explain controversy, propose how your research addresses it.

## Red Flags

- ❌ All references older than 5 years (outdated)
- ❌ Too many references from same author/institution (bias)
- ❌ No diversity in methodology or perspective
- ❌ References not directly related to RQs (off-topic)
- ❌ Only 1-2 sources (foundation too weak to proceed)
- ❌ All references from predatory journals (check Beall's List)

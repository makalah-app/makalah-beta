# Transition: Outline Locked → Drafting

**Current Phase**: outline_locked
**Next Phase**: drafting

## Completion Criteria

- Outline approved and structure locked
- User begins writing section content
- First section draft started (Methods or Lit Review recommended)
- Understanding of academic writing tone and style
- Citations properly integrated (in-text + reference list)

## What Happens Next

1. Draft each section according to outline
2. Expand bullet points into full paragraphs
3. Integrate references with proper citations
4. Maintain academic tone and objectivity
5. Build coherent arguments section by section
6. Continue until all sections drafted

## Common Questions

**Q: "Mulai dari section mana?"**
A: Easiest to hardest: Methods (most structured) → Lit Review (reference-heavy) → Results (data-driven) → Discussion (interpretive) → Intro (contextual) → Conclusion (summary) → Abstract (LAST).

**Q: "Berapa lama per section?"**
A: Depends on length. Typical: Methods 1-2 days, Lit Review 3-5 days, Results 2-3 days, Discussion 3-4 days. Don't rush - quality over speed. Better 500 solid words than 2000 weak words.

**Q: "Pakai bahasa apa? Formal atau santai?"**
A: Academic formal. Avoid: "gue", "lu", "nih", contractions ("it's"), colloquialisms. Use: third person, passive voice (when appropriate), precise terminology, objective tone.

**Q: "Citation style apa yang dipakai?"**
A: Check institution guidelines. Common: APA (psychology, education), Harvard (business, social sciences), IEEE (engineering, CS), Vancouver (medicine). BE CONSISTENT throughout.

**Q: "Boleh copy-paste dari referensi?"**
A: NO! Plagiarism. Always paraphrase + cite. Direct quotes: use sparingly (<5% of paper), with quotation marks + page number. Paraphrasing: rewrite in your own words + cite source.

## Red Flags

- ❌ Copying text from references without citation (plagiarism)
- ❌ Inconsistent citation style (APA in intro, Harvard in methods)
- ❌ No in-text citations (all references only in bibliography)
- ❌ Casual tone or first-person narrative ("Saya akan...")
- ❌ Writing abstract before body sections (wrong order!)
- ❌ Skipping ahead to conclusion without body content

# Transition: Drafting → Drafting Locked

**Current Phase**: drafting
**Next Phase**: drafting_locked

## Completion Criteria

- All major sections drafted (Intro, Body, Conclusion)
- Each section meets minimum word count target
- All references cited properly (in-text + bibliography)
- Academic tone maintained throughout
- User confirms draft is complete
- Ready for integration and coherence check

## What Happens Next

1. Review all sections for completeness
2. Check transitions between sections
3. Verify all research questions addressed
4. Ensure logical argument flow
5. Begin integration phase (connecting sections)
6. Prepare for polishing (grammar, coherence, formatting)

## Common Questions

**Q: "Semua section harus perfect sebelum lanjut?"**
A: No! Drafting_locked means "complete enough to integrate", not "publication-ready". Expect 70-80% quality. Polishing phase will refine to 95%+. Don't over-edit individual sections yet.

**Q: "Abstract sudah ditulis?"**
A: Should be written NOW (after all body sections). Abstract summarizes: Background (1-2 sentences), Methods (1-2 sentences), Results (2-3 sentences), Conclusion (1 sentence). Total: 150-300 words.

**Q: "Word count target tercapai?"**
A: Check: Undergraduate thesis 8000-12000 words, Master's 15000-20000 words, PhD 50000-80000 words, Journal article 5000-8000 words. Under 90% of target = not ready. Over 120% = too verbose, needs trimming.

**Q: "Semua RQ sudah dijawab?"**
A: MUST YES! Review: Each research question should be addressed in Results/Discussion. If any RQ unanswered, draft incomplete. If RQ no longer relevant, remove it or rewrite.

**Q: "Citation count cukup?"**
A: Check ratio: Undergraduate 8-12 refs for 10k words (0.8-1.2 refs per 1000 words). Master's/journal: 2-4 refs per 1000 words. Too few = lack of grounding. Too many = over-citing.

## Red Flags

- ❌ Missing sections (e.g., no conclusion, no methods)
- ❌ Sections incomplete or placeholder text remaining
- ❌ Word count <80% of target (underdeveloped)
- ❌ Research questions not addressed in Results/Discussion
- ❌ No abstract written yet (write it now!)
- ❌ References cited but missing from bibliography (broken citations)

# Transition: Outlining → Outline Locked

**Current Phase**: outlining
**Next Phase**: outline_locked

## Completion Criteria

- Complete paper structure created with headings/subheadings
- All major sections defined (Intro, Body, Conclusion)
- References allocated to relevant sections
- Logical flow validated (each section builds on previous)
- User approves outline and ready to write content
- Word count targets set for each section

## What Happens Next

1. Outline becomes the blueprint for drafting
2. Begin writing section content (start with easiest section)
3. Each section drafted according to outline structure
4. Content fills in the skeleton created by outline
5. No major structural changes (only minor refinements)

## Common Questions

**Q: "Harus mulai nulis dari mana? Abstract dulu?"**
A: NO! Abstract written LAST (it summarizes completed paper). Start with: Methods (if empirical) OR Literature Review (if theoretical). These are most structured. Intro and Conclusion written after body sections.

**Q: "Boleh ubah outline nanti kalau nulis?"**
A: Minor tweaks OK (subsection reordering, heading refinement). Major changes (new sections, restructure) = red flag, means outline wasn't thorough. Better to fix outline now than rewrite later.

**Q: "Semua section harus sama panjang?"**
A: No. Typical ratios: Intro 10-15%, Lit Review 20-30%, Methods 10-15%, Results 20-25%, Discussion 20-25%, Conclusion 5-10%. Adjust based on paper focus.

**Q: "Outline sudah OK, tapi masih bingung mau nulis apa?"**
A: Normal! Outline = structure, not content. For each section, list 3-5 bullet points of what to cover. Then expand bullets into paragraphs. Start with bullet points first.

## Red Flags

- ❌ Outline approved but user uncertain about content
- ❌ No clear starting point for drafting
- ❌ Sections not mapped to research questions
- ❌ Outline too vague (just "Introduction", "Body", "Conclusion")
- ❌ Outline references allocated randomly (not by relevance)
- ❌ User wants to "see how it goes" (no plan = chaos)

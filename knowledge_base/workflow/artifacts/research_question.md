# Research Question Artifact

## Description
The central question or thesis statement that the paper aims to answer. This artifact defines the scope and direction of the entire research. It's formulated during topic_locked phase and guides all subsequent phases.

## Format Expected
- **Primary question**: Main research question (starts with "How", "Why", "What", "To what extent", "Does")
- **Sub-questions** (optional): Supporting questions that break down the main inquiry
- **Hypothesis** (if applicable): Testable prediction for empirical studies

## Extraction Patterns
Model typically mentions research questions as:
- "Pertanyaan penelitian: [question]"
- "Research question: [question]"
- "Kita ingin menjawab: [question]"
- "This paper asks: [question]"
- "Hipotesis: [hypothesis]"
- "The study investigates whether..."

## Quality Indicators
- Clear and specific (not vague or overly broad)
- Answerable with available methodology and data
- Relevant to field and contributes new insight
- Aligned with literature gap identified during research
- Measurable or evaluable (empirical) or logically arguable (theoretical)

## Natural Language Context
- "Pertanyaan penelitian: Apakah algoritma AI menunjukkan bias gender dalam diagnosis medis?"
- "Research question: How does screen time affect children's cognitive development?"
- "Kita ingin tahu: Sejauh mana perubahan iklim mempengaruhi produksi padi?"
- "The study asks: What factors contribute to employee burnout in remote work environments?"
- "Hipotesis: Penggunaan screen time >2 jam/hari berhubungan dengan penurunan kualitas tidur anak"

# Reference Requirements

## Quality Standards

### Peer-Reviewed Sources
- **Journals**: High-impact factor preferred (check SJR/Scopus rankings)
- **Conference Papers**: Tier A/B conferences (CORE rankings, IEEE, ACM)
- **Books**: Academic publishers (Springer, Elsevier, Wiley, Oxford, Cambridge)
- **Reports**: Government agencies, WHO, UN, World Bank, reputable NGOs

### Recency Guidelines
- **Ideal**: Last 5 years (60-70% of references)
- **Acceptable**: 5-10 years old (20-30% of references)
- **Classic Works**: >10 years old (10% of references, only if seminal)
- **Exception**: Historical topics may require older sources

### Credibility Indicators
- ✅ Indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, or IEEE Xplore
- ✅ Multiple citations (check Google Scholar citation count)
- ✅ Authors affiliated with reputable institutions
- ✅ Clear methodology and peer review process
- ✅ Published in recognized journal or conference
- ✅ DOI or stable URL available

## Quantity Guidelines

| Paper Type | Minimum References | Ideal Range | Maximum |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| Undergraduate Thesis | 8-12 | 12-18 | 25 |
| Master's Thesis | 15-25 | 20-35 | 50 |
| PhD Dissertation | 30-50 | 40-80 | 150 |
| Journal Article | 20-40 | 25-50 | 75 |
| Conference Paper | 10-20 | 15-30 | 40 |

**Note**: Quality > Quantity. Better to have 10 highly relevant sources than 30 tangentially related ones.

## Red Flags

### Unacceptable Sources
- ❌ Wikipedia articles (use only for initial exploration, NEVER cite)
- ❌ Blog posts without peer review or expert authorship
- ❌ Preprints without validation (arXiv, bioRxiv - use with extreme caution)
- ❌ Commercial websites or promotional content
- ❌ Social media posts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- ❌ News articles (unless analyzing media discourse)
- ❌ Predatory journals (check Beall's List, Think.Check.Submit)

### Quality Concerns
- ⚠️ All references from same author/institution (lack of diversity)
- ⚠️ All references >10 years old (outdated literature)
- ⚠️ No methodological diversity (all surveys, no experiments)
- ⚠️ References not directly related to research questions
- ⚠️ Only self-citations (no engagement with broader field)

## Search Strategies

### 1. Start Broad
- **Google Scholar**: Best for initial exploration and citation chaining
- **Semantic Scholar**: AI-powered relevance ranking
- **ResearchGate**: Access to preprints and author profiles
- **Academia.edu**: Broader academic content

### 2. Narrow Down with Specialized Databases
- **Scopus**: Multidisciplinary, high-quality peer-reviewed content
- **Web of Science**: Citation tracking and impact metrics
- **PubMed**: Medical and life sciences
- **IEEE Xplore**: Engineering and computer science
- **JSTOR**: Social sciences and humanities
- **ACM Digital Library**: Computer science

### 3. Search Techniques
- **Boolean operators**: "AI bias" AND healthcare AND diagnosis
- **Phrase search**: "machine learning" + "algorithmic fairness"
- **Exclude terms**: bias -political -media (focus on technical bias)
- **Year filtering**: 2019-2024 for recent work
- **Citation chaining**: Review references in key papers

### 4. Find Review Papers
- Search: "[your topic] + systematic review"
- Example: "AI bias healthcare systematic review"
- Reviews summarize 50-100+ papers, excellent starting point

### 5. Track New Research
- Set up Google Scholar alerts for keywords
- Follow key authors on ResearchGate
- Subscribe to relevant journals' table of contents alerts

## Indonesian-Specific Resources

### Indexed Indonesian Journals
- **SINTA** (Science and Technology Index): Indonesia's journal ranking
  - SINTA 1-2: High quality, acceptable for thesis
  - SINTA 3-4: Moderate quality, use sparingly
  - SINTA 5-6: Lower quality, avoid if possible
- **Garuda** (Garba Rujukan Digital): Indonesian research repository

### Language Balance
- **Undergraduate**: 40-60% English, 40-60% Indonesian OK
- **Master's**: 60-70% English recommended for international relevance
- **PhD**: 70-80% English expected, especially for STEM fields
- **Journal submission**: Check target journal's language policy

## Citation Freshness by Field

- **Fast-moving fields** (AI, ML, data science): Prioritize last 3 years
- **Moderate fields** (psychology, education): Last 5-7 years acceptable
- **Slow-moving fields** (philosophy, history): Last 10-15 years OK
- **Foundational theory**: Classic works essential regardless of age

## Common Questions

**Q: "Can I cite Wikipedia?"**
A: NO for academic papers. Use Wikipedia to find original sources, then cite those. Wikipedia acceptable for: popular culture topics, current events context, exploratory phase only.

**Q: "Are preprints (arXiv) acceptable?"**
A: Use with caution. OK if: 1) Very recent topic, 2) Authors are established researchers, 3) Preprint from reputable archive, 4) Acknowledged as non-peer-reviewed. Prefer published versions when available.

**Q: "How many self-citations are OK?"**
A: Maximum 10-15% of total references. Self-citations show continuity of research but excessive use suggests isolation from broader field.

**Q: "Can I cite undergraduate theses?"**
A: Generally NO. Use journal publications from same research. Exception: If thesis contains unique dataset/analysis not published elsewhere, cite with caution.

**Q: "What if source is in another language (Chinese, German)?"**
A: Acceptable if relevant and credible. Cite in original language + provide English translation in brackets. Example: "Zhang (2023). '中国的人工智能偏见' [AI Bias in China]. Journal of AI Ethics."

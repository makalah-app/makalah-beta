# Academic Writing Quality Checklist

## Grammar & Mechanics

### Sentence Structure
- ✅ No run-on sentences (max 25-30 words per sentence)
- ✅ Varied sentence length (mix short and long for readability)
- ✅ No sentence fragments (every sentence has subject + verb)
- ✅ Parallel structure in lists (all items same grammatical form)
- ✅ Active voice preferred (passive OK when appropriate)

**Examples**:
- **Run-on**: "AI bias is a problem it affects healthcare decisions it requires regulatory oversight."
- **Fixed**: "AI bias is a problem. It affects healthcare decisions and requires regulatory oversight."

### Grammar
- ✅ Subject-verb agreement ("The data **are** analyzed" not "The data **is** analyzed")
- ✅ Correct pronoun usage ("this study" not "this research" when referring to your work)
- ✅ Proper article usage ("the AI system" vs "an AI system")
- ✅ No double negatives ("not uncommon" → "common")
- ✅ Consistent number agreement ("participant**s**... their results" not "participant... their results")

### Punctuation
- ✅ Commas in series: "AI, machine learning, and neural networks" (Oxford comma)
- ✅ Semicolons for related independent clauses: "AI bias exists; it requires mitigation."
- ✅ Colons for introducing lists: "Three methods: surveys, experiments, interviews."
- ✅ No comma splices ("AI is powerful, it has limitations" → "AI is powerful**;** it has limitations")
- ✅ Em dashes for emphasis: "The findings—though preliminary—suggest bias."

### Spelling
- ✅ Consistent variant (US vs UK): "analyze/analyse", "color/colour", "center/centre"
- ✅ No typos (run spell-check, proofread manually)
- ✅ Correct technical terms ("algorithm" not "algorythm", "neural network" not "neuronal network")
- ✅ Proper capitalization ("Machine Learning" → "machine learning" unless proper noun)

**Tool**: Grammarly, ProWritingAid, MS Word spell-check (run at least 2 tools)

## Academic Tone & Style

### Formal vs Informal

**Avoid Informal Language**:
- ❌ Contractions: "don't", "can't", "it's" → **Use**: "do not", "cannot", "it is"
- ❌ Colloquialisms: "a lot of", "kind of", "pretty much" → **Use**: "many", "somewhat", "approximately"
- ❌ Slang: "cool", "awesome", "guys" → **Use**: "interesting", "remarkable", "researchers"
- ❌ First person casual: "I think", "I feel" → **Use**: "This study suggests", "Evidence indicates"
- ❌ Rhetorical questions: "Why does this matter?" → **Use**: "This matters because..."

**Maintain Professional Tone**:
- ✅ Objective language (not emotional or subjective)
- ✅ Precision (not vague generalizations)
- ✅ Third person or "we" (not "I" unless single-author opinion piece)
- ✅ Evidence-based claims (not unsupported opinions)

### Clarity & Conciseness

**Eliminate Wordiness**:
- ❌ "Due to the fact that" → **Use**: "Because"
- ❌ "In order to" → **Use**: "To"
- ❌ "At this point in time" → **Use**: "Now" or "Currently"
- ❌ "A large number of" → **Use**: "Many"
- ❌ "Conduct an investigation into" → **Use**: "Investigate"

**Be Specific**:
- ❌ "Many studies show..." → ✅ "12 studies (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021; ...) show..."
- ❌ "The results were significant..." → ✅ "The results were statistically significant (p < .001, d = 0.65)..."
- ❌ "In recent years..." → ✅ "Between 2020-2024..."

### Hedging (Appropriate Caution)

**Use Hedging for Interpretations** (not facts):
- ✅ "These findings **suggest** that..." (not "prove")
- ✅ "This **may indicate**..." (not "demonstrates")
- ✅ "Results **appear to show**..." (not "clearly show")
- ✅ "It **is possible that**..." (not "it is certain that")

**Don't Overhedge** (undermines your work):
- ❌ "It **might possibly perhaps** be the case that..." → Too tentative
- ❌ "This **humble study** suggests..." → Unnecessary self-deprecation
- ❌ "We **believe** the findings..." → Use evidence, not belief

## Coherence & Flow

### Paragraph Structure

**Each paragraph should**:
- ✅ Have ONE main idea (topic sentence)
- ✅ Be 5-8 sentences long (too short = underdeveloped, too long = unfocused)
- ✅ Include supporting details and evidence
- ✅ End with transition or conclusion sentence

**Example Structure**:
1. **Topic sentence**: Introduces main idea
2. **Supporting sentences**: Evidence, examples, citations
3. **Transition sentence**: Links to next paragraph

### Transitions Between Sections

**Use transition words/phrases**:
- **Addition**: Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, In addition
- **Contrast**: However, Nevertheless, In contrast, On the other hand
- **Cause/Effect**: Therefore, Consequently, As a result, Thus
- **Example**: For instance, For example, Specifically, In particular
- **Time**: Subsequently, Previously, Following, Next
- **Summary**: In summary, Overall, In conclusion, To summarize

### Logical Argument Flow

- ✅ Claims supported by evidence (cite sources)
- ✅ Clear connections between ideas (transition words)
- ✅ No logical fallacies (correlation ≠ causation, overgeneralization, false dichotomy)
- ✅ Consistent terminology (don't switch between "AI system" and "algorithm" randomly)
- ✅ Progressive buildup (simple → complex, general → specific)

---

## Citations & References

### In-Text Citation Quality
- ✅ All claims supported by citations (not just opinions)
- ✅ Direct quotes have page numbers: (Smith, 2023, p. 45)
- ✅ Paraphrasing preferred over direct quotes (<5% direct quotes)
- ✅ Multiple sources for major claims: (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021; Lee, 2022)
- ✅ Recent sources (60-70% from last 5 years)

### Reference List Quality
- ✅ Every in-text citation has matching reference
- ✅ Every reference is cited in text (no orphaned references)
- ✅ Consistent formatting (all APA, or all Harvard, or all IEEE)
- ✅ Alphabetical order (APA/Harvard) or numbered correctly (IEEE/Vancouver)
- ✅ DOIs or URLs included for online sources
- ✅ No Wikipedia, blogs, or non-credible sources

### Citation Accuracy
- ✅ Author names spelled correctly
- ✅ Publication years accurate
- ✅ Journal names correct and properly formatted

## Quality Assurance Strategies

### Multi-Pass Review
1. **Pass 1** (Content): Argument flow, research questions, completeness
2. **Pass 2** (Clarity): Sentence structure, paragraph coherence, transitions
3. **Pass 3** (Grammar): Spelling, punctuation, tense, voice
4. **Pass 4** (Citations): In-text citations, reference list, formatting
5. **Pass 5** (Formatting): Headings, tables/figures, spacing, margins

### Read-Aloud Technique
- ✅ Read paper aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
- ✅ Mark sentences that are hard to say (likely need rewriting)
- ✅ Verify logical flow (does argument make sense when spoken?)

### Peer Review
- ✅ Ask colleague/classmate to read
- ✅ Specific questions: "Is RQ2 clearly answered?" "Is Table 3 understandable?"
- ✅ Accept constructive criticism (improve, don't defend)

### Wait and Revise
- ✅ Finish draft, wait 24-48 hours
- ✅ Fresh eyes catch errors you previously missed
- ✅ Revise with distance (less emotionally attached)

## Common Quality Issues

### ❌ Overgeneralization
**Bad**: "All AI systems are biased."
**Fix**: "Many AI diagnostic systems exhibit measurable bias (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021)."

### ❌ Vague Claims
**Bad**: "The results were significant."
**Fix**: "The results were statistically significant (t(248) = 3.45, p = .001, d = 0.44)."

### ❌ Unsupported Assertions
**Bad**: "AI bias harms patients."
**Fix**: "AI bias can lead to misdiagnosis and unequal treatment (WHO, 2023)."

### ❌ Inconsistent Terminology
**Bad**: Uses "AI system", "algorithm", "model", "tool" interchangeably without definition
**Fix**: Define once ("We refer to the AI diagnostic system as 'the algorithm' throughout this paper") and use consistently

### ❌ Logical Fallacies
**Bad**: "Since AI bias was found in one study, all AI systems are biased." (overgeneralization)
**Fix**: "Bias has been documented in multiple AI diagnostic systems (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021; Lee, 2022), suggesting a systemic issue requiring further investigation."

**Final Reminder**: Quality is iterative. First draft = 70-80% quality. Revision brings to 95%+. Allocate time for multiple revision rounds. Perfectionism is the enemy of completion, but sloppiness undermines credibility. Aim for excellence, not perfection.

# Delivered Phase

## Description
Paper is complete, polished, and submission-ready. Model provides final manuscript, confirms completion, and suggests next steps (venue selection, submission checklist). This is the terminal phase; no further workflow progression.

## Natural Language Indicators
- "Paper sudah selesai"
- "Manuscript complete"
- "Delivered!"
- "Siap submit"
- "Paper is ready"
- "All done"
- "Finished writing"
- "Submission-ready"
- "Let's submit this"
- "Paper complete"

## Model Behavior
- Confirm that all phases are complete
- Provide final manuscript summary (sections, word count, reference count)
- Suggest next steps: choose submission venue, review journal guidelines, prepare cover letter
- Celebrate completion with user
- Offer to help with submission-related tasks (not part of workflow, but post-delivery support)
- Archive conversation as completed project

## Exit Criteria
None. This is the terminal phase. User may start new paper (new conversation) or end session.

## Common Variations
- Selesai, delivered, complete, done, finish, siap submit
- "Oke terima kasih", "Sudah selesai", "All done", "Finished"
- Code-switching: "Paper is delivered", "Manuscript done"
- Typos: "selesai", "delievered", "complte"
- Jakarta slang: "Udah kelar", "Beres nih", "Selesai deh"

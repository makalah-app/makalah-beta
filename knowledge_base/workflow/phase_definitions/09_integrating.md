# Integrating Phase

## Description
Connecting all drafted sections into a coherent, unified manuscript. Model focuses on transitions between sections, ensuring logical flow, argument consistency, and narrative cohesion. This is about making the paper read as one piece, not separate sections.

## Natural Language Indicators
- "Mari integrasikan section-section ini"
- "Hubungkan bagian-bagian ini"
- "Let's integrate the sections"
- "Buat transisi antar section"
- "Ensure coherence"
- "Connect the dots"
- "Make it flow smoothly"
- "Cek konsistensi antar bagian"
- "Link sections together"
- "Improve transitions"

## Model Behavior
- Review section-to-section transitions for logical flow
- Add transition paragraphs or sentences where needed
- Ensure argument consistency across sections (no contradictions)
- Check that Introduction sets up Discussion, Methods align with Results
- Verify that references are cited consistently
- Ensure narrative arc: problem → approach → findings → implications

## Exit Criteria
Manuscript is coherent and flows well; ready for final polishing → Transition to `polishing`

## Common Variations
- Integrasi, hubungkan, transisi, coherence, flow, konsistensi
- "Sambungkan bagian ini", "Buat transisi", "Connect sections"
- Code-switching: "Let's integrate", "Ensure flow"
- Typos: "integras", "transisi antar bagian"
- Jakarta slang: "Sambungin dong", "Bikin mulus", "Lu cek konsistensinya"

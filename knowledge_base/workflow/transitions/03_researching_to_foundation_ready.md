# Transition: Researching → Foundation Ready

## Trigger Conditions
- Sufficient high-quality references gathered (≥5-8 peer-reviewed sources)
- Model confirms literature base is strong enough
- User agrees that research phase is complete
- Key themes and patterns identified from literature

## Natural Language Signals
- "Referensi sudah cukup"
- "Foundation ready"
- "Oke, research selesai"
- "Literature is sufficient"
- "Mari lanjut ke outline"
- "Enough sources gathered"
- "Kita punya cukup literatur"
- "Let's move to outlining"
- "Research complete"
- "Bisa mulai outline sekarang"

## Guardrails
- Must have minimum 5-8 credible references
- Cannot transition with only 1-2 sources (foundation too weak)
- References must cover main aspects of research question
- Cannot skip back to researching without model prompting for more sources

## Common User Expressions
- Sufficiency: "Cukup", "Enough", "Sudah oke", "Complete", "Done"
- Transition: "Lanjut", "Move on", "Next phase", "Let's outline"
- Approval: "Setuju", "Ya", "Oke", "Good", "Approved"
- Code-switching: "Research is done", "Let's proceed"
- Jakarta slang: "Udah cukup nih", "Bisa lanjut", "Oke lanjut"

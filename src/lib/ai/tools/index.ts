/**
 * Tools Module - PENDING REBUILD
 *
 * Old search implementation removed (Oct 2025):
 * - academic-tools.ts (generic web_search)
 * - search/ directory (multi-provider abstraction)
 *
 * Awaiting new implementation:
 * - search_literature (specialized academic search with quality control)
 * - Based on spec: __references__/workflow_tools/search_tool.md
 *
 * For now, chat API uses native provider tools:
 * - OpenAI: web_search (native)
 * - OpenRouter: :online suffix (native)

// No exports currently - tools directory under reconstruction
// TODO: Implement search_literature tool based on new spec
